## Summary
  - In summary I feel the ice cream shop WILL work year round and be sustainable.  Multiple and further in depth queries can be performed and a greater grasp of the environment.  In my personal opinion (and based off the above charts) I think it isnt a weather question that will effect the ice cream shop.  Temperatures stay relatively the same give or take some spikes.  So I feel this is more of a "seasonal recipe" or "seasonal food" problem. Develope things that are sold by season.
